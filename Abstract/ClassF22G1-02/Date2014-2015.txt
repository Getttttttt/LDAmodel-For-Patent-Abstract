id-WO2015101360A1    abstract-本发明提供一种加快生物质热解产气速度并获得纳米级二氧化硅材料的装置及方法。该装置包括螺旋给料装置、预处理搅拌器、热解装置、燃烧装置、蒸汽发生器及煅烧装置。生物质原料通过螺旋给料装置送入预处理搅拌器，搅拌后的生物质原料与蒸汽发生器产生的过热水蒸汽混合后进入热解装置，热解装置析出的可燃气体进入燃烧装置燃烧，燃烧装置燃烧所产生的热烟气加热蒸汽发生器产生过热水蒸气，热解装置下部的灰渣口排出的灰渣进入煅烧装置中煅烧。本发明使用过热水蒸气对生物质原料进行加热和干燥，比同温度热空气烘干生物质原料的方法干燥速度高，从而使系统的热解气体析出速度比常规系统热解气体析出速度和产气热值大大提高。
id-WO2015116259A1    abstract-A steam generator includes a furnace configured and adapted to generate steam from heat transfer from furnace exit gases from the combustion of municipal solid waste fuel, where tempering air (200) is used for at least two purposes. First, to prevent or minimize corrosion of heat transfer surfaces, specifically a plurality of platens and at least one superheater (108) disposed within an upper portion of the furnace or backpass and second to push and exert a force on the hot flue gas to change the flow pattern and improve superheater metal temperatures.
id-US20150253003A1    abstract-A boiler system is provided comprising: a furnace adapted to receive a fuel to be burned to generate hot working gases; a fuel supply structure associated with the furnace for supplying fuel to the furnace; a superheater section associated with the furnace and positioned to receive energy in the form of heat from the hot working gases; and a controller. The superheater section may comprise a platen including a tube structure with an end portion and a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature of the tube structure end portion and generating a signal indicative of the temperature of the tube structure end portion. The controller may be coupled to the temperature sensor for receiving and monitoring the signal from the sensor.
