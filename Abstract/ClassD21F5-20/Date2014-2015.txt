id-US9702084B2    abstract-The invention relates to a process and a machine for making a tissue paper web (W) in which the tissue paper web W is passed through an extended nip N formed between an extended nip unit ( 2 ) and a Yankee drying cylinder ( 1 ) and in which the tissue paper web W is carried on a felt ( 3 ) through the extended nip N in such a way that, in the extended nip N, the tissue paper web W contacts the outer surface ( 4 ) of the Yankee drying cylinder ( 1 ). The web W and the felt ( 3 ) are led over a suction roll ( 5 ) prior to the extended nip N in such a way that the felt ( 3 ) contacts the suction roll ( 5 ) and the tissue paper web W is separated from the suction roll ( 5 ) by the felt ( 3 ). The suction roll ( 5 ) has a suction zone ( 6 ) over which the felt ( 3 ) and the tissue paper web W pass together, and a first hood ( 7 ) is arranged opposite the suction roll ( 5 ) and partially surrounds the suction roll ( 5 ). The first hood ( 7 ) has an extension around the suction roll such the first hood ( 7 ) covers the entire suction zone ( 6 ), and moist hot air is fed from the first hood ( 7 ) and sucked through the tissue paper web and the felt ( 3 ) by the suction roll ( 5 ). The tissue paper web W is directly exposed to the first hood ( 7 ) such that the moist hot air reaches the tissue paper web W without passing through a fabric before reaching the tissue paper web W. The Yankee drying cylinder ( 1 ) is covered by a second hood ( 8 ) which is a Yankee hood which has an air heating and distribution system ( 9 ) and hot exhaust air from the second hood ( 8 ) is fed through a conduit ( 10 ) to the first hood ( 7 ) and used to supply the first hood ( 7 ) with moist hot air. The moist hot air has a temperature in the range of 130° C.-300° C. and a moisture content of 300 g/kg dry air-1000 g/kg dry air at a rate of 90-130 m 3 /minute per square meter suction zone area. The moist air is then sucked through the tissue paper web W by the suction roll ( 5 ) such that moisture condensates on the tissue paper web W and thereby raises the temperature of the tissue paper web W before the tissue paper web W passes through the extended nip N.
