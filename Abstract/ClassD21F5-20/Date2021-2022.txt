id-EP4089230A1    abstract-The present invention relates to a drying plant for desiccating paper material, preferably in the form of a tape, the said drying plant comprising: - At least one drying roll (112) fed with steam in such a way as to heat up and on which the paper material to be dried is arranged in use; - At least one hood (114) arranged in such a way as to wrap, at least partially, the said drying roll, the said hood being configured in such a way as to send onto the said drying roll a drying airflow which hits the said drying roll and being further configured to suck in the damp drying flow going up in use from the paper material under drying positioned on the said drying roll; - At least one first separating tank (101) configured to separate the steam from the condensate and placed into fluid communication with the said drying roll in such a way as to receive the fluid coming from the said drying roll and separate steam from condensate; - and wherein a heat exchanger (104) is comprised; - said heat exchanger being placed into fluid communication with said first separating tank through a first part of a conduit (103) which connects said first separating tank with said heat exchanger; - and wherein a pump (102) arranged along the said first part of conduit is comprised, the pump being therefore interposed between said heat exchanger and the first tank and with the said pump configured to push the condensate contained into said tank towards the heat exchanger; -  Characterized  by the  fact of  comprising a second tank (108), said second tank being a second separating tank configured to separate steam from condensate and placed into fluid communication with the said heat exchanger through a second part of a conduit (107), said second part of conduit being without pump, the said pump arranged in the first part being configured in such a way as to push the condensate coming from the first separating tank into the heat exchanger (104) and contextually push the consequent fluid obtained from said heat exchanger towards the second separating tank (108), the said second tank being connected to a third part of a conduit (109) configured to send the steam, separated from the condensate, in outlet from said second separating tank, said third part of conduit connecting to the said drying roll (112) in such a way that the drying roll can receive the obtained steam and coming from said second separating tank and wherein, further, the said second separating tank provides an outlet for discharging condensate.
id-WO2022269135A1    abstract-The invention relates to a method for cleaning moist exhaust gas comprising the steps of: supplying moist exhaust gas to a mixing chamber (10), the moist exhaust gas having a first temperature; supplying fresh outside air to the mixing chamber (10), the fresh outside air having a second temperature, the second temperature being below the first temperature; mixing the moist exhaust gas and the fresh outside air together in the mixing chamber (10) for forming a mist containing water vapor; generating a mist having the relative humidity of 100% by supplying additional fresh air to the mixing chamber (10) and mixing the additional fresh air with the mist in the mixing chamber (10); creating cleaned exhaust gas and droplets; directing the droplets from the mixing chamber (10) to a collection basin (13), discharging the cleaned exhaust gas as discarded air from the mixing chamber (10) to outdoors.
id-CN113737558A    abstract-本发明提供了一种卫生纸机扬克缸汽罩用的防结露节能热风箱，属于卫生纸生产技术领域，包括机架、扬克缸汽罩、抽吸组件以及热风箱本体，所述扬克缸汽罩安装在扬克缸上部，所述扬克缸汽罩包括干端汽罩以及湿端汽罩，所述热风箱本体设置在所述湿端汽罩侧壁。本发明实施例中，通过抽吸组件直接从干端汽罩内抽吸未饱和湿热空气进入湿度更大的湿端汽罩中，进而节省新热风用量，提高了热能利用效率，节省新鲜蒸汽；通过热风箱本体将未饱和湿热空气由出风部输送至湿端汽罩内部，使湿端汽罩内部蒸发的湿汽尽快上升，减少湿汽在湿端汽罩内侧底部的停留时间，防止湿端汽罩内壁湿汽水分子聚集结露滴水的情况发生。
