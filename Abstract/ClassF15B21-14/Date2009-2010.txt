id-US8589038B2    abstract-A hydraulic drive system for a working machine provides improved safety during forced regeneration. Upon input of a forced regeneration command signal from a forced regeneration switch, a controller detects non-operated states of all hydraulic actuators such as an arm cylinder arranged on a hydraulic excavator based on a lock detection signal from a gate lock detection switch, and also an attitude of a front working mechanism. The attitude is proper from the standpoint of safety. The detection is based on an arm angle signal from an arm angle sensor, a bucket angle signal from a bucket angle sensor and a boom pressure signal from a boom pressure sensor. Taking the detection of the non-operated states and proper attitude as conditions, the controller outputs control signals to a boosting proportional solenoid valve and flow-rate controlling, proportional solenoid valve to make a forced regenerator conduct forced regeneration.

id-US20130133853A1    abstract-A device for fluid power recuperation with reduced heat losses and increased efficiency of fluid power recuperation combined with better manufacturability and possibility of using off-the-shelf gas receivers (bottles). The device comprises at least one hydropneumatic accumulator, containing in its shell a fluid port communicating with the fluid reservoir of the accumulator separated from the gas reservoir of the accumulator by a movable separator. The gas reservoir of the accumulator communicates via a gas port with at least one gas receiver containing a regenerating heat exchanger made in the form of a metal porous structure. The aggregate volume of the material of the regenerating heat exchanger is in the range from 10 to 50% of the internal receiver volume and the aggregate area of the heat exchange surfaces of the regenerating heat exchanger reduced to the aggregate internal receiver volume exceeds 2000 cm 2 /liter. At gas compression or expansion the heat exchange between the gas and the regenerating heat exchanger occurs at small average distances between the gas and the heat exchange surfaces and on a large heat exchange area, and, therefore, with smaller temperature differentials, which increases reversibility of the heat exchange processes and recuperation efficiency. The proposed device has the following properties:—reduced heat losses and increased efficiency of fluid power recuperation;—better manufacturability;—possibility of using off-the-shelf gas receivers of any type in the device.
