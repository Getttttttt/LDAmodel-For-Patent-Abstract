id-AU2011225455B2    abstract-Disclosed is a coal-fired power plant provided with a first flow rate control valve which adjusts the amount of water flowing through a water supply bypass system, a second flow rate control valve disposed on an air extraction pipe which extracts steam from a steam turbine, a first temperature sensor disposed on the downstream side of a heat recovery device, and a second temperature sensor disposed on the downstream side of a heat exchanger. Moreover, the coal-fired power plant is provided with a control unit, which adjusts the aperture of the first and second flow rate control valves on the basis of the exhaust gas temperature detected by means of the first temperature sensor and the water supply temperature detected by means of the second temperature sensor. As a consequence, it is possible to prevent the reliability and efficiency of the plant from deteriorating, even when the exhaust gas temperature or the exhaust gas flow rate fluctuates as a result of the boiler deteriorating over time and when the amount of heat collected by means of the heat recovery device disposed on the smoke path fluctuates.
