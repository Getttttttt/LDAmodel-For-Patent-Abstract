id-US20100180568A1    abstract-The invention adds details and alternate design supplementing the concept established with my patent application Ser. No. 12/013,431, Aircraft Propulsion System (APS). The APS ultimate fuel economy objectives requires long term design development, and this invention compromises some fuel economy for the expediency of short term implementation of a heat regeneration for turbofans via the re-arrangement of existing components and a few unique items readily designed. While this Velarus Propulsion (VPx) attains only 42% fuel economy, it retains the original APS fundamental architecture implementing heat regeneration for a turbofan engine, as well as the additional benefits of noise and emission abatement. This invention consists of the three APS technologies as follows:         a) A novel arrangement of the power generation core features the turbine exhaust entering directly into the thrust chamber, thus providing heat regeneration with an appropriate configuration of the thrust chamber.   b) The design of a modified combustor introduces the concept of a supersonic nozzle driving the turbines which allows for greater combustor's chamber temperature while injecting the gases at temperatures acceptable to current turbine blade metallurgy. This feature increases the engine thermal efficiency.   c) The hub design allows for two options, a simpler fixed fanblade design or an advanced controllable pitch fan blade, increasing the mission and performance flexibility of a given turbofan size. In addition, this invention adds functionality to the aft cone, such as debris purge, accessories installation, and thrust reversers free from hot gases.

id-US8573291B2    abstract-An annular design heat exchanger is formed from an arrangement of wedge-shaped stacks of wafers. Each wafer includes sheets of material separated by peripheral and supporting walls that define interior flow channels through which a first fluid can flow. Holes in the sheets provide inlets and outlets to the channels, and walls surrounding the holes mate with neighboring wafers in the stack, forming integral inlet and outlet manifolds, while ensuring uniform spacing between the wafers. A second fluid can flow around the manifolds and through the spaces between the wafers in a counterflow pattern. In the annular assembly, the manifolds are oriented substantially axially, and the flow channels are oriented substantially radially. The heat exchanger can be formed from a ceramic material, and can be incorporated into an engine assembly or a heat-recirculating combustor.
