id-AU2009227990B2    abstract-A device (10) for reclaiming water from moist air discharged from a cooling tower (14). The device (10) includes a heat exchanger (16) including an air flow path (18) extending between an air inlet port (20) and an air outlet port (22), and a water flow path (24) extending between a water inlet port (26) and a water outlet port (28). The heat exchanger (16) is configured for, in use, mounting the air inlet port (20) at least partially in a flow path of air discharged from the cooling tower (14) to generate a flow of moist air through the heat exchanger (16) along the air flow path (18). The heat exchanger (16) fluidly connects the water inlet port (26) to the water cooled in the cooling tower (14), and fluidly connects the water outlet port (28) to the water cooled in the cooling tower (14). A pump (38) is provided for pumping water about a water flow loop (29) extending from water cooled in the cooling tower (14), through the heat exchanger (16) along the water flow path (18) from the water inlet port (26) to the water outlet port (28), and from the water outlet port (28) back to the water cooled in the cooling tower (14). A water collection device (42) is also provided for mounting downstream of the air outlet port (22) for collecting water condensed from moist air flowing along the air flow path (18).
