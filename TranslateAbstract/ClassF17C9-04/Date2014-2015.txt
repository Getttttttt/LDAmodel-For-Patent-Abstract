id-US20150219391A1    abstract-A method and apparatus for recovering boil-off gas from a head space of a liquid storage tank having a fluid contained therein is provided. The method can include the steps of withdrawing the boil-off gas from the storage tank and introducing said boil-off gas to a heat exchanger using a vapor flow inducer; cooling the boil-off gas in the heat exchanger by using cold energy from vaporization of liquid nitrogen to form a cooled fluid; and introducing the cooled fluid to the liquid storage tank, thereby reducing the temperature within the liquid storage tank.

id-US10480353B2    abstract-Various examples are provided for cryogenic power extraction. In one example, among others, a system for cryogenic power extraction includes a heat exchanger that can heat a cryogenic working fluid using exhaust heat from a heat source, and a turbine that can generate power from the heated cryogenic working fluid. In another example, a method includes heating a cryogenic working fluid with waste heat from a heat source and driving a turbine with the heated cryogenic working fluid. Power produced by the turbine can be used drive a mechanical load and/or generate electricity for use by an electrical load. For example, waste heat from a combustion engine of a vehicle can be used to generate power for driving mechanical loads of the engine and/or to generate electricity for charging a battery of the vehicle.

id-WO2015130193A1    abstract-ï»¿The invention relates to systems supplying ship consumers with gas fuel on carriers transporting LNG and using as main energy source the transported natural gas in liquefied state and, in particular, effective usage for these purposes of continuously generated gas due to natural evaporating of LNG in cargo tanks.
