id-EP2236904A1    abstract-A process for transferring a liquefied natural gas, hereinafter LNG, contained at an initial pressure (Pi) in a LNG carrier (32), to at least one storage tank (31) at a storage pressure (Ps), prior to its regasification for emission to a transmission system, the process comprising the following steps: - the extracted LNG is transferred to the storage tank (31) in the liquid state and at a storage pressure (Ps), the storage pressure being such that the difference between this pressure and the initial pressure (Pi) is greater than or equal to 200 millibars; - the LNG being kept in the storage tank in the liquid state and at the storage pressure (Ps); Process in which - when filling the tank with LNG from the LNG carrier, the evaporated LNG, referred to as BOG, is discharged from the storage tank (31) and then expanded through expansion means (361) so that the BOG is at a pressure equivalent to the initial pressure (Pi); - a fraction of the quantity of BOG is taken and then re-injected into the LNG carrier (32) at a volume rate equivalent to the LNG extraction rate in order to keep the pressure in the LNG carrier (32) roughly equal to the initial pressure (Pi).
