id-JP2009269469A    abstract-[challenges] providing a power generation mechanism that can generate a fixed amount of power stably near the tires of a vehicle. The friction between the discropper 4 (rotating member), which rotates synchronously with the rotation of the axle S, and the brake pad 32 (pressing member), which is pressed against the discropper 4 without synchronizing with the rotation of the axle S, causes the rotation of the axle S to stop. In the brake system to be applied, thermoelectric conversion element 6 is installed on the disrotor 4. The thermoelectric conversion element 6 generates electricity by using the heat generated by the friction between the inverter 4 and the brake pad 32. The thermoelectric conversion element 6 is mounted on the surface on the S side of the axle in disk part 42 of the disrotator 4 that does not interfere with the brake pad 32.
