id-WO2023135026A1    abstract-The disclosure concerns a waste heat recovery unit (10) comprising a main heat exchanger (13) configured to exchange heat between an exhaust fluid from a heat source and a working fluid of a waste heat recovery system, wherein the waste heat recovery unit (10) comprises an additional heat exchanger (12) configured to exchange heat between the exhaust fluid and alternatively a cooling fluid or a portion or the whole of said working fluid during transitory states.

id-US11619379B2    abstract-A solar thermodynamic power generator includes: a quartz window placed on a metal shell to form an electromagnetic resonant cavity structure for receiving solar energy; a ceramic conduit placed in the metal shell, wherein a working medium is heated in the ceramic conduit by the solar energy; a heat exchanger placed in a vacuum insulation oil tank; a steam generator placed in the vacuum insulation oil tank; a ceramic heating tube placed in a combustion chamber; and a turbine communicating with the steam generator through a fifth pipeline and a sixth pipeline. The present invention is environmentally friendly, safe, low-cost, high-efficiency, pollution-free, emission-free, and not affected by natural weather or environment. Like natural gas, the present invention can be configured to perform grid-connected power generation. Furthermore, after the hydrogen fuel and the hydrogen silicon fuel are mixed and burned, waste hydrogen can be recycled and reused.
