id-WO2016163380A1    abstract-The side air conditioner (3a, 3b) consists of a casing (31a, 31b), a side heat exchanger (33a, 33b) that USES a refrigerant supplied from the side air conditioner (2) to cool or heat the air in the casing (31a, 31b) and a side air conditioner (3a, 3b). The air supply and exhaust mechanism that takes in indoor and outdoor air from the air conditioned space and the air conditioned space, supplies the air supplied to the air conditioned space, and displaces the air as the air discharged to the air conditioned space, and the refrigerant leakage detection device (48a, 48b) that detects the refrigerant, etc. It has. Here, when the refrigerant leakage detection device (48a, 48b) detects the refrigerant, the refrigerant discharge operation is carried out by the supply and exhaust mechanism together with the air in the casing (31a, 31b) to discharge the refrigerant out of the air conditioning space.
