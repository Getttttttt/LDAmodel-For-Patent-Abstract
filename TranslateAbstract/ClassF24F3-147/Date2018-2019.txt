id-US20200408425A1    abstract-The device and method of the invention are adapted to control temperature and humidity of the air in some defined volume such as a room in a house. The device consists of a quantity of hygroscopic material and means for passing air past or through the material. Direct temperature and humidity control occur when air is conditioned (heated and dried by sorption heating, or cooled and humidified by absorption cooling) and sent inside the room; indirect control is also possible, by affecting the temperature of the walls (the sorption material may occupy channels or spaces within the walls, which are then heated/cooled, indirectly heating/cooling the air in the room by conduction). A fan or blower will allow for forced convection of air in a desired path (e.g from outside the house, over/through the sorption material, and into the house, or in the opposite direction). A second fan and valves allow for more complex operations.

id-US11181294B2    abstract-An air conditioning apparatus saves space, has a low cost and a high energy efficiency. In a former stage, total heat exchange is carried out in a total heat exchange rotor which performs heat exchange between the return air from the indoor space and outdoor air. A passive desiccant rotor, if provided, may eliminate a the need for a regenerative heat source in a latter stage. Latent heat exchange is performed in a heat pump circuit which exchanges heat between the outdoor air and the return air which have undergone total heat exchange. Further, the air conditioning apparatus may realize reduction of the total cost of equipment by eliminating the outdoor unit, and may realize reduction of on-site construction cost after the installation of the equipment and shortening of the construction term.

id-JP2021167675A    abstract-[problem] there is a problem of providing a humidification unit that can increase the humidification amount even when the amount of regenerated air is limited. Since the temperature of the air heated by the first heating device 41 drops after passing through the first water release region 51b, the heat energy of the air heated by the first heating device 41 is insufficient even if it enters the second water release region 52b. Therefore, the air passing through the first moisture release region 51b is heated by the second heating device 42, which provides heat energy, and then enters the second moisture release region 52b. This makes it possible to increase the amount of humidification even when the amount of regenerated air is limited. Figure 1a is the selection diagram.
id-US20200009500A1    abstract-A device for exchange of water molecule and temperature between two fluids. The device comprises thin molecular sieve membrane sheets that allow water molecules to permeate through while blocking cross-over of the exchanging fluids. The device provides two sets of flow channels having a hydraulic diameter ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 mm for respective process and sweep fluid flows. The two sets of the channels are separated by a membrane sheet having a thickness less than 200 Î¼m. The thin molecule sieve membrane may be prepared by forming an ultra-thin zeolite membrane layer on a porous metal-based support sheet which provides very high water permeance so that the exchange can be conducted in a compact membrane module at high throughput. The device can be used to remove water from a process stream of higher water content by use of a sweep fluid of lower water content or higher water affinity. For example, the device can be used to condition outdoor fresh air close to the temperature and humidity of indoor air by conducting humidity and heat exchange between the fresh air flow drawn from outdoors and waste air discharged indoors.

id-US20200107467A1    abstract-An electronic equipment enclosure which regulates incoming outside air to within the operational limits of the electronic equipment within is described. The enclosure recirculates the wasted heat from the equipment to regulate both the temperature and humidity within the enclosure to acceptable levels without relying on any heating or air conditioning component. Thus, the enclosure assembly relies entirely on air flow for regulating the temperature inside the enclosure. Additionally, the recirculation feature of the enclosure allows the electronic equipment to operate at outside temperatures much lower than the stated operational range by modifying the temperature of the intake air of the equipment. A method of controlling the temperature inside an enclosure is also described.
