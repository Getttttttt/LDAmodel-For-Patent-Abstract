id-WO2014108980A1    abstract-The Rankine cycle unit (20) is equipped with a pump (23), an evaporator (24), an expander (21) and a condenser (22). The evaporator (24) has a plurality of heat transfer tubes (28) arranged in multiple stages in the direction of the flow of the high-temperature fluid to be exchanged with the working fluid. The heat transfer tube (28), which is located at the upstream stage in the direction of the high-temperature fluid flow, is defined as the topmost heat transfer tube (28k). For example, the momost heat transfer tube (28k) forms the inlet of the evaporator (24) so that the working fluid that enters the evaporator (24) first flows through the momost heat transfer tube (28k).

id-WO2014183235A1    abstract-The utility model relates to A direct air-cooled turbine compound condensing heat exchange system, which comprises A condensing heat exchanger (1), B condensing heat exchanger (2), heat network circulating pump (5), A peak cooling tower (3), B peak cooling tower (4), a peak cooling water circulating pump (6) and B peak cooling water circulating pump (7). The return water of the circulating water of the heat network enters the condensation heat exchanger (1, 2) after the pressure is raised by the circulating pump of the heat network (5), and then heats to the heat network to recover the waste heat, and then heats to the external heat supply after reaching the required temperature; When it is used as the peak cooling equipment, the condensation heat exchanger (1, 2) and the peak cooling tower (3, 4) form a closed cycle cooling water system, and part of the exhaust steam is extracted for cooling. The steam supply system, air pumping system and drainage system of the two condensation heat exchangers (1, 2) are set to use the switching mother pipe mode to meet the waste heat recovery of the two units' single heating operation.
id-US20140374109A1    abstract-Methods and systems for enhanced carbon dioxide capture in a combined cycle plant are described. A method includes compressing a recycle exhaust gas from a gas turbine system, thereby producing a compressed recycle exhaust gas stream. A purge stream is extracted from the compressed recycle exhaust gas stream. Carbon dioxide is removed from the extracted purge stream using a solid sorbent.

id-US11261760B2    abstract-The disclosed apparatus and control system produces a single, on demand, energetic gaseous working fluid from any heat source. Working fluid in a liquid phase is released into a heat exchange tube in the form of very fine droplets or atomized mist, where it is rapidly heated to its gaseous phase. The gaseous working fluid can continue to absorb heat before exiting the heat exchange tube to perform work. The disclosed system controls the release of working fluid into the heat exchange tube and/or the heat energy to which the tube is exposed, resulting in a flow of energetic gaseous working fluid that can be quickly adjusted in response to changing conditions without a large pressure vessel.

id-US20160281975A1    abstract-A method of operating a combined heat and power plant ( 10 ) (CHP plant) is provided. The CHP plant ( 10 ) includes a hot flue gas generator ( 12 ) generating hot flue gas which is then cooled in a sequence of cooling steps to recover heat and to generate steam in a heat recovery steam generator ( 16 ) (HRSG). The HRSG ( 16 ) includes a steam evaporator ( 26 ) downstream of the hot flue gas generator ( 12 ), and at least one steam superheater ( 22 ) between the hot flue gas generator ( 12 ) and the steam evaporator ( 26 ). The steam superheater ( 22 ) is configured to superheat, during normal operating conditions of the CHP plant ( 10 ), at least steam ( 110 ) imported into the HRSG ( 16 ). The method includes, when there is insufficient heat removal from the hot flue gas downstream from the hot flue gas generator ( 12 ) but upstream of the steam evaporator ( 26 ) as a result of insufficient mass flow of imported steam ( 110 ) to the steam superheater ( 22 ), to the extent that the hot flue gas temperature downstream of the steam superheater ( 22 ) will rise or rises to or above a predetermined limit, quenching steam inside the steam superheater ( 22 ) or steam being fed to the steam superheater ( 22 ) by injecting boiler feed water or condensate ( 162 ) into the steam to produce steam in the steam superheater ( 22 ) thereby to increase the removal of heat from the hot flue gas and hence to reduce the hot flue gas temperatures downstream of the steam superheater ( 22 ).
