id-WO2009096028A1    abstract-The gas turbine equipment 20, the exhaust heat recovery boiler 3 that generates steam from the exhaust heat recovery boiler, the steam turbine equipment 25 that is driven by the steam from the exhaust heat recovery boiler, and the steam extracted from the steam turbine equipment are transmitted to the water manufacturing equipment 30 The supplied bleed air pipe 64, bleed air flow control valve 9 provided in the bleed air pipe 9, and the output command value (MWD) from the plant that changes with the daily change of air temperature are lower than the rated output value (MWD0) of gas and steam turbine equipment. When and gas turbines and steam turbines equipment total output (MW) output command value (MWD) approach the output instruction deviation value (MW0) based on steam turbines the 抽気 steam (GblsD) flow rate control with Stage 110. This makes it possible to operate the gas turbine equipment at close to the rated level even when the atmospheric temperature drops, thereby improving the efficiency of the power supply system for the plant.
id-US9624109B2    abstract-A method in which a parent hydrocarbon-rich material is processed so as to produce both a carbon-rich solid material that has a higher carbon to hydrogen ratio than that of the parent material and a carbon-deficient combustible gas that has a lower carbon to hydrogen ratio than the parent material. In the process, the material is activated by exposing it to a hot gas stream having elevated levels of one or both of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The combustible gas is combusted to produce heat. At least about 80% of the heat is used in one ore more endothermic steps that include drying coal or biomass.

id-EP2143891A2    abstract-A device for controlling a steam turbine and a combined cycle plant bypass system thereof includes: an acquisition module (9), for acquiring operating quantities measurements (Q HP , P HP ) of a combined cycle plant (1) including a gas turbine (2) and a steam turbine (3); a plurality of calculation modules (36-45), configured to determine, according to corresponding control modes, at least a first pressure set point (P HPCV ) for a regulator (30) of a high-pressure inlet valve (27a) and a second pressure set point (P HPBP ) for a regulator (30) of a high-pressure bypass valve (28a) of a high-pressure section (12) of the steam turbine (3); a supervisor module (35), configured to detect an operating condition of the plant (1) on the basis of the operating quantities (Q HP , P HP ) acquired by the acquisition module (9) and to selectively activate one of the calculation modules (36-45) in response to the detected operating condition.

id-US8176724B2    abstract-This invention provides a method of converting heat energy to a more usable form using an externally-heated Brayton cycle. Atmospheric air is used with water injection in a thermodynamic cycle that includes compression ( 1 ), evaporative cooling ( 34 ), recuperative heating ( 8 ), evaporative cooling ( 36 ), external heating ( 9 ) and expansion through a turbine ( 2 ). Power capacity and overall efficiency are maximized by decreasing the temperature of working fluid entering recuperator ( 8 ) and heater ( 9 ) while increasing the mass flow through turbine ( 2 ). Overall efficiency during turndown is maximized using a portion of low-pressure working fluid from the turbine in a three-chamber combustor wherein volume flow into the first chamber containing solid fuel determines the system energy, volume flow into the second chamber combines with partially combusted gases from the first chamber to achieve the optimum combustion temperature and volume flow into the third chamber blends with combustion gases from the second chamber to limit the hot gas to the maximum temperature allowed by the system equipment.
