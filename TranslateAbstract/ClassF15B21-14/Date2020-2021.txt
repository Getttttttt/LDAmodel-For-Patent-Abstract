The hydraulic circuit also includes a reclamation device that is disposed in the hydraulic circuit between the prime mover and the actuator. The reclamation device captures and stores a portion of hydraulic fluid displaced from the actuator during a transition between opposed motions, where the portion of hydraulic fluid corresponds to an amount of hydraulic fluid equal to a volume of fluid required to compensate for compression of fluid within the hydraulic circuit due to system pressure and load pressure. The stored fluid is used by the circuit in a subsequent motion.
