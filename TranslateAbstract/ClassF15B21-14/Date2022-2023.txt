id-US11668072B1    abstract-A system and method for storing potential energy for a material handler. The system and method involves actuating a machine element using hydraulic cylinders; measuring a position of the machine element; controlling the hydraulic cylinders with a hydraulic circuit by an electronic control unit; determining a maximum target pressure for at least one gas actuator coupled to the machine element; calculating a target pressure for the at least one gas actuator at the position; measuring a gas pressure measurement from the at least one gas actuator; comparing the target pressure to the gas pressure measurement; and adjusting a hydraulic adjustment valve to increase or decrease an amount of hydraulic fluid within a hydraulic chamber of an accumulator thereby changing a gas pressure within the at least one gas actuator to correspond to the target pressure.
