id-US20110139092A1    abstract-Provided is a reheat boiler in which the imbalance in temperature distribution of the temperature of the combustion gas at the outlet of a reheat furnace is reduced by changing the gas flow pattern in the reheat burner. A reheat boiler includes a main boiler configured such that main combustion gas generated in combustion in a burner flows from a furnace through a superheater and evaporator tubes, a reheat furnace that is disposed on the downstream of the evaporator tubes and produces reheat combustion gas by combustion in a reheat burner, and a reheater disposed above the reheat furnace. A closing plate, serving as a drift preventing portion, is provided at a reheat furnace outlet that connects the reheat furnace and the reheater to form a flow path for the combustion gas and the reheat combustion gas so as to narrow the cross-sectional area of the flow path for the combustion gas.
