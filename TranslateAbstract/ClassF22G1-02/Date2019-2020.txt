id-JP2020143634A    abstract-[challenges] we provide a gas turbine waste heat recovery plant that can reduce the lifetime consumption rate by suppressing thermal stress due to sudden output fluctuations. A plurality of gas turbine exhaust heat recovery devices and exhaust heat recovery boilers, including gas turbine 10b, a exhaust heat recovery boiler 20 that recovers the exhaust heat of gas turbine 10b and generates steam. In a steam utilization unit 503 that USES steam generated by ra 20 and multiple gas turbine exhaust heat recovery units, a portion of the water heated by at least one gas turbine exhaust heat recovery unit or a portion of the steam generated by the exhaust heat recovery unit is used to generate other gas turbines. The internal heat medium supply unit 504f can be supplied to the exhaust heat recovery unit. Select diagram in figure 12.
