id-JP2013520307A    abstract-The invention relates to a fluidized bed reactor device 10. In the fluidized bed reactor unit 10, the fluidized bed reactor has at least a bottom 12, a ceiling 16, and at least one side wall 14.1 extending vertically between the bottom and the ceiling, which is a cross section of the reaction chamber 20 of the reactor. In addition, the fluidized bed reactor device has a heat exchange chamber 30, and the above inclined side wall 14.1 provides a bulkhead between the heat exchange chamber and the reaction chamber 20 Form. In connection part 36, the rear wall 34 of the heat exchange chamber is connected from the upper part of the back wall to the side wall 14.1 of the reaction chamber 20, so that its orientation is consistent with the direction of the side wall at least in connection area 36.
id-US9677831B2    abstract-A device with a heat exchanger with a feed pipe for a medium leading from a medium inlet to the heat exchanger entrance and with a discharge pipe leading away from the heat exchanger exit is characterized in that it has a first bypass from the medium inlet to the discharge pipe and a second bypass from the feed pipe to the medium outlet and valves, so that the medium can also flow from the heat exchanger exit to the heat exchanger entrance.
