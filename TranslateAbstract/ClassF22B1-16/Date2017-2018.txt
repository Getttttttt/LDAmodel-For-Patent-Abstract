id-US20200277881A1    abstract-Disclosed is a process that combines interacting main processes and sub-processes to extract kinetic energy from thermal energy. These different interacting processes and sub-processes are physically separate from each other with the main processes operating as closed cycles that operate with two different process fluids parallel to each other and interact with each other, in order to consider and utilize sufficiently all three forms of energy, i.e. thermal energy, kinetic energy, and the energy of the phase changes. By interacting, these different main processes and sub-processes enable a ‘combined-process’ that especially allows the highly efficient transformation of low temperature thermal energy into kinetic energy. Also disclosed is a system for carrying out the process.

id-US20190170024A1    abstract-A global cooling system including a heat-exchanger-boiler, a heat-exchanger-condenser, a pump, a compressor, a rotary-device, a generator, an electrical power-inverter, and a voltage-regulator, in a preferred embodiment. The global cooling system utilizes a high-temperature-liquid, which may be water, from a water-source to heat the low-temperature-liquid, which may be a refrigerant, to produce net heat and therefore power a generator via a Rankine Cycle. The system configured to convert heat from the high-temperature-fluid to the low-temperature-fluid such that the heat is absorbed from the high-temperature-fluid into the low-temperature-fluid to convert the high-temperature-fluid such that the high-temperature-fluid is cooled to produce an electrical and/or mechanical output. Also included is a method of using a global cooling system.
