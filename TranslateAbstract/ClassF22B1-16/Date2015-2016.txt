id-US9657600B2    abstract-A heat exchanger includes an electrolytic bath and a control section. The electrolytic bath has first and second channels. A first fluid can flow through the first channel. A second fluid adapted to exchange heat with the first fluid can flow through the second channel. At least part of the first and second channels of the electrolytic bath is partitioned by anode and cathode plates to which a given potential is applied from a power source. The control section applies the given potential to the anode and cathode plates and performs polarity reversal adapted to reverse the polarity of the anode and cathode plates after having applied the given potential at given time intervals.

id-WO2017057261A1    abstract-In the steam generation unit (1), the heat medium continuously circulates along the circular path (33) from the heat tank 30 through the steam generator 31 and the solar collector 2, and then returns to the heat tank 30. The solar concentrator (2) heats the heat medium with the concentrated sunlight, and the steam generator (31) generates the liquid steam by using the heat medium to heat the liquid. A bypass flow path (340) is provided to connect the branch position between the heat tank (30) and the steam generator (31) in the circular path (33) and the junction position (344) between the steam generator (31) and the solar collector (2). The heat medium passing through the living unit (31) is mixed with the heat medium passing through the bypass channel (340) and sent to the solar collector (2). When the amount of solar radiation is high, steam is generated in the steam generator (31) and heat is stored by raising the temperature of the heat medium oil in the heat medium tank (30) in a short time.
