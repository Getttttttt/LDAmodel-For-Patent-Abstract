id-US9518480B2    abstract-An exhaust heat recovery device  1 , with a Rankine cycle for recovering and using exhaust heat of an engine  10  includes: a Rankine cycle  2  including a heater  22 , an expander  23 , a condenser  24 , and a pump  25 ; a bypass flow passage  26  allowing the refrigerant to circulate while bypassing the expander  23 ; a bypass valve  27  opening and closing the bypass flow passage  26 ; and a control unit  4 . When starting up the Rankine cycle  2 , the control unit  4  executes start-up control of the Rankine cycle  2  in which the pump  25  is actuated with the bypass valve  27  open and then the bypass valve  27  is closed. Furthermore, the control unit  4  repeatedly executes the start-up control when the pressure difference between the high-pressure side and the low-pressure side of the Rankine cycle  2  after closing the bypass valve  27  does not reach the start-up completion determination value within a predetermined time.

id-WO2013170915A3    abstract-The invention relates to an apparatus (18) for warming gas, providing a radiator (19) for the portal (1) of the machine, and a heating cycle (17) providing a first heat source (24) for fuel heating, which is another heat source (17) connected to a heating ring (19). In addition, it covers the first nuclear power plant (27) and its working procedures.
id-US9551241B2    abstract-To provide a waste heat recovery power generation plant for sintering facility capable of efficiently recovering a waste heat of a sintering machine in addition to that of a sintered-ore cooler, while restraining that sulfuric anhydride contained in an exhaust gas of the sintering machine forms drops. An SM boiler is configured to heat all of or a part of hot water generated by an SC boiler, by introducing a high temperature part of an exhaust gas of a sintering machine. At this time, a temperature of the hot water to be supplied to the SM boiler is controlled such that a temperature of an exhaust gas at an exhaust-gas temperature of the SM boiler is maintained at a temperature higher than an acid dew point.

id-US9003799B2    abstract-Heat flow from a steam seal header could be used in a stage, such as a low pressure stage, of a steam turbine. However, the dump steam temperature from the steam seal header can be too high requiring removal of excess heat, typically through attemperation, before the dump steam is provided to the low pressure stage. Attemperation poses reliability and life issues and lowers efficiency. To address such short comings, one or more heat pumps are used to transfer heat from the dump steam to the fluid entering a boiler. This allows the dump steam temperature to be within acceptable limits, and at the same time, increase the temperature of the fluid so that the steam cycle performance is enhanced. Preferably, solid-state heat pumps are used as they are reliable, silent and can be precisely controlled.
