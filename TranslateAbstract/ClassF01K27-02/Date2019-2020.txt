id-WO2020158941A1    abstract-The company provides technology to efficiently store and utilize surplus energy generated in power plants at different temperatures. Thermal storage device 140 includes multiple thermal storage parts that recover and store heat from fluid passing through the internal flow path, the first thermal storage part with temperature characteristics in the first temperature range, and the second thermal storage part with temperature characteristics in the second temperature range lower than the first temperature range. The second heat storage part and the first channel 241 pass the inflow fluid in the order of the first heat storage part and the second heat storage part; the second channel 242 bypass the first heat storage part and pass the inflow fluid in the order of the second heat storage part; and the first opening and closing of the first channel 241 arranged on the first channel 241 Lateral 251 and the second open and close valve 252 arranged on the second flow path 242. The first open and close valve 251 is open when the temperature of the fluid is above the first temperature threshold, and the second open and close valve 252 is open when the temperature of the fluid is below the first temperature threshold. It is characterized by being open.

id-JP2022520595A    abstract-The invention relates to an energy conversion method, in which the working substance of the first heat pump (I) absorbs the amount of heat from the output working substance gas of the air pressure machine (J) and condenses the output working substance gas of the air pressure machine (J) to operate the pressure. When the material liquid is obtained, the pressure working substance liquid is transported as the input pressure working substance of the air pressure machine (J), and the heat is compressed by the first heat pump (I) to raise the temperature. The pressure working substance gas is output from the air pressure (J) as the output pressure working substance gas of the air pressure (J) after the air pressure (J) is activated. The working material of the first heat pump (I), which has been reduced by transferring the amount of heat to the input pressure working material, is transferred to newly absorb the amount of heat from the output pressure working material gas of the air pressure machine (J). The working substance of the heat pump (I) includes heat absorption, temperature rise, and temperature reduction is repeated. Select diagram: figure 4
