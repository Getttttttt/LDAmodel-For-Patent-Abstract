id-US10378389B2    abstract-Disclosed is a gas turbine and pressurized water reactor steam turbine combined circulation system, using a heavy duty gas turbine and a pressurized water reactor steam turbine to form a combined circulation system. Heat of the tail gas of the gas turbine is utilized to raise the temperature of a secondary circuit main steam from 272.8° C., and the temperature of the secondary circuit main steam slides between 272.8° C. and 630° C. according to different pressurized water reactor steam yields and different input numbers and loads of the heavy duty gas turbine. The system has a higher heat efficiency than that of the pressurized water reactor steam turbines in the prior art; and as for the electric quantity additionally generated by gas, the heat efficiency of the system is also significantly higher than that of gas-steam combined circulation in the prior art.
