id-US9140209B2    abstract-A waste heat recovery (WHR) system connects a working fluid to fluid passages formed in an engine block and/or a cylinder head of an internal combustion engine, forming an engine heat exchanger. The fluid passages are formed near high temperature areas of the engine, subjecting the working fluid to sufficient heat energy to vaporize the working fluid while the working fluid advantageously cools the engine block and/or cylinder head, improving fuel efficiency. The location of the engine heat exchanger downstream from an EGR boiler and upstream from an exhaust heat exchanger provides an optimal position of the engine heat exchanger with respect to the thermodynamic cycle of the WHR system, giving priority to cooling of EGR gas. The configuration of valves in the WHR system provides the ability to select a plurality of parallel flow paths for optimal operation.
id-US20140144136A1    abstract-A combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system is provided. The combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system comprises the internal combustion engine, the waste heat recovery system, and a ratio adapting device. The internal combustion engine includes a turbocharger. The waste heat recovery system comprises a condenser, a pump, a heat exchanger, and an expander. The expander is in driving engagement with the turbocharger. The ratio adapting device is drivingly engaged with an output of the internal combustion engine and the expander of the waste heat recovery system. The ratio adapting device may be engaged to transfer energy from at least one of the turbocharger and the expander to the output of the internal combustion engine.
id-EP2735833A3    abstract-The invention relates to a carburetor, which is a partially or wholly liquid flow carburetor, in particular a steam medium in a steam cycle, with a gas carrier on the main side; Use Sekundarseite Flussigkeitsstrom and a Dampfstrom filled with enthusiasm from Flussigkeitsstrom across components The Warmetrager data is used for simultaneous Primarseite for the first Stromungskanal for the gas Warmetrager, from the Warmetragereinlass Warmetragerauslass story, or many first for gas Stromungskanalen Warmetrager. The stromungsleitend will be separated or the stromungsleitend will be joined basically parallel to each other along a Langsachse Verdampfers, a common Warmetragereinlass and a joint Warmetragerauslass; Parallel to the second Stromungskanal Sekundarseite one or many about Durchstromung Flussigkeitsstrom and/or Dampfstrom geschaltete the second Stromungskanale. The shared liquid inhalation method was also invented which marks the management of a third Stromungskanal in Sekundarseite or a third Stromungskanale with the same symptoms in a parallel geschaltete in Durchstromung, or in a Kuhlmediumstrom Kuhlmediumeinlass leads to a common Kuhlmediumauslass and/with a Primarseite warmeubertragender connect/station for gas Warmetrager cooling.
