id-WO2015135792A1    abstract-The invention relates to the Dampfkraftanlage:(1) and the Niederdruck-Teilturbine (2c) is so designed that its Schluckfahigkeit (M s) is lower than the Schluckfahigkeit (M s) The specific interpretation of max) Niederdruck-Teilturbine (2c) is also equivalent to maximum Lastfall without Fernwarme-Auskopplung (24).
id-US20190003341A1    abstract-Implementations described and claimed herein provide systems and methods for providing energy to a defined space, such as a house or other building. In one implementation, thermal energy is received from a solar power source at a solar boiler, and steam is generated from the thermal energy using the solar boiler. One or pistons of a steam engine is driven with a pressure from the steam. The steam engine outputs a first waste heat. The first waste heat is received from the steam engine at a chiller. The chiller generates conditioned air from the first waste heat.
id-US20150285101A1    abstract-A combined heat and power system according the present disclosure includes a Rankine cycle apparatus including an evaporator that heats a working fluid by heat exchange between the working fluid and a heat source medium, an expansion machine that converts expansion power of the working fluid into rotational power, and a condenser that cools the working fluid by heat exchange between the working fluid and a heat medium, and a thermal circuit for using the heat medium heated by the condenser. An expansion volume ratio of the expansion machine is equal to or less than an expansion ratio in a theoretical Rankine cycle determined based on a state of a temperature and a pressure of the working fluid at a discharge port of the expansion machine and a state of a temperature and a pressure of the working fluid at a suction port of the expansion machine.
id-EP2927583A1    abstract-The invention includes an electromagnetically useful bonding system to reduce heat, and the use of backup fuel to generate electricity to increase heat requirements. (8) To enable a commercial heater to be used on more thrusters and to make use of the heat generated by the electrician, it is recommended to use an auxiliary burner (1) to discharge into an auxiliary burner (14).
id-US20150369085A1    abstract-An evaporator which heats working fluid with high-temperature fluid to evaporate the working fluid includes: a working fluid channel which is arranged in a flow direction of the high temperature fluid and through which the working fluid flows; and a temperature sensor which is provided for the working fluid channel. A part of the working fluid channel is exposed to outside of a housing of the evaporator, and the temperature sensor is provided in the part of the working fluid channel exposed to the outside of the housing of the evaporator in a region other than an inlet of the working fluid channel into which the working fluid flows from the outside of the evaporator and other than an outlet of the working fluid channel through which the working fluid flows out of the evaporator. The output value of the temperature sensor is used to adjust the temperature of the working fluid in the evaporator.
