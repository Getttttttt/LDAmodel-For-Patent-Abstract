id-US20200217587A1    abstract-Heat exchange structure. A hydrophilic, thermally conductive porous medium includes nanostructures formed substantially uniformly throughout the porous medium providing a balance of capillary and viscous forces to self-regulate a liquid-vapor contact line. A suitable porous medium is copper. A method for making the structure is also disclosed.
