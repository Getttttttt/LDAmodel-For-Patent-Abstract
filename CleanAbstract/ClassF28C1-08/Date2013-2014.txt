id-WO2014194350A1    abstract-A cooling tower system (100) including: a heat exchanger (102) into which a treatment fluid is fed, the heat exchanger (102) transferring energy from a vapour stream to a treatment fluid to produce a heated treatment fluid and a cooled vapour stream; a wet evaporative cooling tower (104) fluidly connected to the heat exchanger (102), the heated treatment fluid and an evaporating fluid being fed into the cooling tower (104), the cooling tower (104), in use, separating an evaporable content from the heated treatment fluid to produce a concentrated treatment fluid and a vapour mixture containing the evaporable content; and a vapour compressor (106) fluidly connected between the cooling tower (104) and the heat exchanger (102), the vapour compressor (106), in use, compressing the vapour mixture from the cooling tower (104), to produce a compressed vapour mixture stream, the compressed vapour mixture stream being fed into the heat exchanger (102) as the vapour stream that transfers energy to the treatment fluid flowing to the heat exchanger (102).
