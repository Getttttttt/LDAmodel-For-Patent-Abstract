id-US8925217B2    abstract-Method for steam recapture in the drying of a tissue paper web with a cylinder that is fed from a live steam network and with a hot air hood that flows hot air onto the tissue paper web, includes the steps of: removing condensate from the cylinder; compressing the condensate to a first pressure level essentially corresponding to that of the live steam network; heating the condensate by heat exchange with the exhaust air from the hot air hood; vaporizing the condensate; and feeding generated steam into the live steam network.
id-US20100206505A1    abstract-A machine and process for production of wet formed fibrous webs, in which the web is formed from a suspension on a fabric and subjected to a final drying process such as a Yankee dryer roll, while further subjecting the Web to an intermediate drying on a high-heat-transfer roll, with or without hood, before the final drying process. The intermediate dryer roll has a solid, gas-impermeable surface, and a localized heat source directly heats the dryer to a higher temperature than in the final drying process.
id-US20100206506A1    abstract-A machine and process for production of a fibrous web, with a forming section ( 2 ) in which the web is formed from a pulp suspension on a fabric ( 3 ) and with a final drying unit ( 4 ). In at least one further drying step, a rotatable dryer ( 5 ) with a hood ( 6 ) is located after the forming section ( 2 ) and before the final drying unit ( 4 ). The additional dryer ( 5 ) has a gas-impermeable exterior surface ( 7 ) which is directly heated by a combustion unit such a gas or oil fired burner ( 9 ).
