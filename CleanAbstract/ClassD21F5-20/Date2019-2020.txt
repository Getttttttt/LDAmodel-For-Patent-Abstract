id-EP3736375A1    abstract-The present invention relates to a method and arrangement for controlling energy consumption in a manufacturing process of a fibrous web, such as paper, board, tissue web or the like. Heated steam is consumed by heating of drying devices, which form at least one drying group inside a drying hood for removal of moisture from the fibrous web, and blowing devices remove humid exhaust air from the drying hood and feed dry heated replacement air into the drying hood. Heated steam is further consumed by heating of replacement air, gaseous process flow(s) and/or liquid process flow(s) to predetermined temperature ranges. The method comprises steps of: maintaining inside the drying hood an air humidity below a predetermined maximum humidity value; determining a total consumption of heated steam consumed by the drying devices and by heating of replacement air and/or the said process flow(s), and adjusting the removal of the humid exhaust air from the drying hood on a level where the total consumption of heated steam is minimised.
