id-US20130284402A1    abstract-The present disclosure provides for a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger generally comprises a duct and substantially parallel tubes having an outer wall and arranged in the duct to define gaps therebetween. An air flow is directed through the duct to deliver heat through the gaps and over the outer walls of the tubes. A second means directs an air flow that receives heat through the tubes. The air flow that delivers heat generally comprises air that is moist, saturated, or near its saturation curve. The heat exchanger also comprises collecting means arranged in the duct for collecting the condensate flowing along the outer walls of the tubes upon exiting from the duct at the outlet.
