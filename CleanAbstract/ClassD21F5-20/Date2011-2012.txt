id-WO2012152546A1    abstract-Invention is a Trockenpartie Warmeruckgewinnung procedure (1) A machine makes a piece of Materialbahn especially Faserstoffbahn paper in the shape of a box or Tissuebahn which is at least indirectly directed to most of the beheizbaren in the Materialbahn Trockenzylindern (TZ wants to go to TZ IVn). Will dry invent it for at least the Materialbahn Durchlaufrichtung through the Trockenpartie:(1) the first Trockenzylinder (TZ wants to go), and as appropriate further this nachgeordnete Trockenzylinder(TZ I2 to TZ) as doppelwandige Trockenzylinder(2) refers to the use of liquid Heizmedium beaufschlagt(um), the scripture explains the temperature of liquid hot gases, That is, the effect of at least the use of "dry city" (1) and/or a large amount of heat generated in the manufacturing material machine in the heated substance.
id-WO2012175446A1    abstract-About the invention created a program to Warmeruckgewinnung Trockenpartie(2) A machine that makes a piece of Materialbahn especially Faserstoffbahn paper shape, carton or Tissuebahn while Materialbahn at least with steam beheizbaren Trockenzylinder (TZ) and by drying at least one Hochtemperatur-Trockenelementes(3) with a hot air balloon, while there will be an Ausgangsfluid producing steam, using a high temperature drum thermal solution (3) to reduce the sludge generation (K2) into a stereo. A feature of this invention is that at least part of the condensate (K2) produced by the drying yeast (friendship) in the heating change (W1) is evaporated after the steam and condenser (clw1) have occurred, and preferably all of it when steam (D) has occurred.
id-US9797092B1    abstract-Disclosed herein is a method and apparatus for improving the heating capacity of steam-heated hot plates, and in particular, to steam-heated hot plates used in the corrugating industry. One or more separators and thermocompressors are added to the output of the hot plates to separate blow through steam from condensate and pressurize and inject the steam back into the hot plates.
