id-WO2012054049A1    abstract-A process fluid cooler (140) can extract thermal energy from a process fluid including carbon dioxide. An absorber (130) can transfer carbon dioxide from the process fluid Io a removal fluid. A reboiler (150) can heat the removal fluid so as Io cause carbon dioxide to be released from the removal fluid and outputted as part of a reboiler output stream. The reboiler can also output a heating fluid A stripper condenser (144) can extract thermal energy (128, 146) from the reboiler output stream so as to cause condensation of water associated with the reboiler output stream and to remove carbon dioxide therefrom. A compression system can remove thermal energy from carbon dioxide received from the stripper condenser. A heat engine can be configured to operate according to an organic Rankine cycle, receiving thermal energy from the heating fluid and/or extracted at the process fluid cooler, at the stripper condenser, and/or at the compression system.
id-WO2012067086A1    abstract-Evaporator 100 is an evaporator that heat exchanges cooling water and refrigerant. Evaporator 100 has refrigerant inlet 17c and refrigerant outlet 17d, refrigerant channel 17f for circulating refrigerant, and heat exchangable with refrigerant inlet 17f, and has heat medium inlet 18c and heat medium outlet 18d for circulating cooling water. Includes the heat medium flow path 18f. The heat medium inlet 18c is arranged in a position corresponding to the refrigerant region from the liquid state to the vapor state through the heat exchange with the cooling water in the refrigerant channel 17f. The heat medium flow path 18f has a baffle 18w that directs the cooling water from the heat medium inflow port 18c to flow along the area of the refrigerant in a vapor state.
