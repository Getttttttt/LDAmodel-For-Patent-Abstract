id-JP2020147185A    abstract-The subject of the present invention is to make the voltage of the auxiliary power supply difficult to fall below the minimum operating voltage of the hydraulic brake system when the main power supply is abnormal. In the hydraulic brake system of the present invention, when the main power supply cannot supply power to the pump motor, etc., it is abnormal that the pump motor is activated without or without a braking request. In this way, when the main power supply is abnormal as described above, there is less opportunity for inrush current to flow. As a result, the voltage of the auxiliary power supply may be less likely to fall below the minimum operating voltage, making it less likely that the hydraulic brake system will become inoperable.
