id-WO2022180918A1    abstract-Provides a degreasing furnace that reduces the load on the flow path of the exhaust gas. The degreasing furnace (10) is the degreasing furnace (10) for degreasing the degreasing product (12), the furnace body (14) for the degreasing product (12), the combustor (40) for combustion while exhausting the gas of the furnace body (14), the combustor (40) A condenser (56) is used to cool and condense the exhaust gas. The first duct (50) leading to the exhaust outlet (48) of the combustor (40), the condenser (56), and the second duct (52) forming a circle to supply gas from the first duct (50) and the second duct (52). The fan (58) for the flow of gas and the third duct (54) for the outflow of gas from the second duct (52) to the outside of the second duct (52).
