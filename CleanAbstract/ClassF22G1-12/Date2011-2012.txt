id-US20170292379A1    abstract-A method which develops a supercritical combustion chamber environment and combines fumigation and water conversion to superheated steam to effect greater fuel efficiency and reduce exhaust gas pollutants from a compression ignition engine. The invention utilizes the fumigant method by combining two gases (DME and heptane) which autoignite prior to the injection of the liquid water. This pre-combustion of the fumigant gases combined with the engine's compression of the combustion chamber gases is managed to attain a supercritical combustion chamber environment into which the liquid water is injected. This targeted supercritical combustion chamber environment causes the water to become a superheated steam, resulting in significantly greater efficiency and negligible exhaust gas pollutants resulting from the steam engine.
