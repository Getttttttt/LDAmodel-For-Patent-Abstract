By providing the ship processing marine waste into a resource including the ship load adjustment device, the present invention can not only reduce the cost of land transportation required to process marine waste which is accumulated in the sea but also can effectively and fundamentally prevent environmental problems that occur in the process of transporting, because the marine waste is processed on the sea by the ship of the present invention. Also, the present invention can fundamentally resolve the secondary environmental problems, such as securing reclaimed land and soil pollution due to conventional burying of marine waste in the land, and transforms the problems of simply burying marine waste, which emits high heat, into creating energy by means of burning. In addition, by using the converted energy for sailing the ship to the locations where marine waste is accumulated, the use of crude oil traditionally required for sailing can be dramatically reduced to cut costs, and furthermore, the converted energy source is high-quality electricity that can be supplied to island regions, which are marginalized areas in terms of power supply, thereby effectively reducing costs for building an additional power generating facility in the island regions and contributing to facilitating access to the energy source.
