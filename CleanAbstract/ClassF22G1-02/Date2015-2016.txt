id-WO2016147023A1    abstract-The invention relates to an incineration plant comprising a furnace (1) including movable grates (14, 18, 20) on which fuel is burned. Flue gases are directed through at least a first and a second vertically extending radiation passes (80, 81, 82) and subsequently through a number of convection passes (83, 84). A first superheater (30) is arranged in one of the convection passes. A second superheater (87, 87a, 87b) com- prises an inner metal pipe (36), through which the steam is flowing and an outer metal casing (38) enclosing the inner metal pipe (36), There is provided a spacing (50) between the inner metal pipe and the outer metal casing. The second superheater is arranged for further heating of steam heated In the first superheater and Is arranged in at least one of: the furnace, the first vertically extending radiation pass (80) and the second vertically extending radiation pass (81).
id-US10077684B2    abstract-An evaporator includes an introducing portion that introduces a heat source gas from a heat source gas pipe, a heat source gas passage through which the heat source gas introduced from the introducing portion flows, a heating portion that is disposed in the heat source gas passage and at which a working fluid is heated by the heat source gas, an increasing portion at which a cross-sectional area of the heat source gas passage gradually increases from an upstream side towards a downstream side in the heat source gas passage, and a flow regulating plate that is disposed on an upstream side from the heating portion in the heat source gas passage and that has a plurality of holes which allow the heat source gas to pass through the plurality of holes.
id-WO2017060818A1    abstract-A convection section assembly including a decliner comprising a refractory material and attached to an inner wall of the convection section assembly at an angle of 0ยบ-90ยบ is disclosed. The decliner is oriented to deflect hot process fluids such as flue gas away from components of the convection section such as a baffle plate, superheating lines and a superheating coil thus reducing or preventing localized overheating, deformation and/or rupture. A system and method for producing superheated steam employing the convection section are also disclosed.
