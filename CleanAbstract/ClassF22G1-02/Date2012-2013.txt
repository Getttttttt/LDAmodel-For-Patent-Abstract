id-US20150121875A1    abstract-A steam generator for generating a superheated fluid from a working fluid using a stream of heated gas, the steam generator comprising: a housing, which defines a gas flow path having an inlet at one, upstream end thereof into which a stream of heated gas is delivered and an outlet at the other, downstream end thereof; and a steam generation module which is disposed within the gas flow path of the housing, the steam generation module comprising a heat exchanger which receives a working fluid and is operative to raise the temperature of the working fluid to provide a saturated fluid, and a superheater which receives the saturated fluid from the heat exchanger and is operative to raise the temperature of the saturated fluid and provide a supersaturated fluid.
id-US10627105B2    abstract-A ground supported single drum power boiler is described combining a refractory lined and insulated V-Cell floor; refractory lined and insulated combustion chamber; integrated fuel chutes configured to pre-dry wet solid fuel; top mounted fuel bin; internal chamber walls; configurable combustion air systems; and a back pass with after-burner ports and cross flow superheaters. The boiler can be configured in pre-assembled modules to minimize the field construction time and cost. An alternative embodiment is adaptable as a gasifier.
id-EP2639414A2    abstract-The invention is based on a fuel cell device with at least one cooling loop connected to a circulating steam turbine. Burning as a coolant in the cooler will increase the efficiency of the fuel cell system and ensure its reliability.
