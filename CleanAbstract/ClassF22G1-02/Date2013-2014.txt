id-US8955467B1    abstract-A steam boiler includes a boiler housing. A helical coil for boiling water and superheating the wet steam is disposed within the boiler housing. A burner emits combustion gases which heat a heat emitter which is disposed in the inner space of the helical coil. Combustion gases from the burner enter the internal cavity of the heat emitter and then pass through perforations in the heat emitter before contacting the helical coil. As such, the heat emitter is heated by the combustion gases and serves as a radiant heat source for the helical coil.
id-US10215399B2    abstract-A small supercritical once-through steam generator (OTSG) includes a radiant section with a furnace coil, and a convection section downstream of the radiant section that includes a superheater which is fluidically connected to the furnace coil. Optionally, the OTSG is devoid of a steam separator. An economizer can also be included downstream of the superheater. Supercritical steam can be generated using the OTSG, for use, among other things, in enhanced oil recovery applications.
id-WO2015068087A1    abstract-A method of operating a combined heat and power plant (10) (CHP plant) includes generating hot flue gas in a hot flue gas generator (12) and cooling the hot flue gas in a sequence of cooling steps to recover heat and to generate steam in a heat recovery steam generator (16) (HRSG). The HRSG (16) includes an HP steam evaporator (26) downstream of the hot flue gas generator (12) in which HP steam is generated and in which the hot flue gas is cooled, at least one HP steam superheater (20, 22) between the hot flue gas generator (12) and the HP steam evaporator (26) in which at least HP steam from the HP steam evaporator is superheated and in which the hot flue gas is cooled, and an MP steam superheater (24) upstream of the HP steam evaporator (26) in which MP steam is superheated by the hot flue gas and in which hot flue gas is cooled.
