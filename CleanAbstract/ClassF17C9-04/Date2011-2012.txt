id-WO2012102849A1    abstract-Methods and systems for regasifying LNG are provided. A method for regasifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) includes providing heat to a LNG regasification process from a power plant. If the heat is not sufficient, additional heat can be provided to the LNG regasification process from a cooling tower operated in a warming tower configuration.
id-US20140013777A1    abstract-The present invention relates to a storage tank having a heat exchanger and a natural gas fuel supply system having the storage tank. The storage tank having a heat exchanger according to one aspect of the present invention includes: a heat exchanger installed in an upper portion of an inside space of the storage tank, wherein the heat exchanger includes: an expansion valve into which LNG, which is highly pressurized by a pressurizer, is introduced; and a heat exchanger pipe which guides a flow of the LNG so that the LNG expands in the heat exchanger.
id-US20130091870A1    abstract-A device for supplying cold gases to an NMR installation or analytical apparatus equipped with a measuring probe, with cold gases ensuring the cooling of the sample contained in the probe, but also its lift and rotation, the device including an insulated tank containing liquid gas at boiling point and in which are arranged exchangers through which gas streams to be cooled pass, these exchangers being connected to transfer lines channeling the cooled gases to the probe. The device also includes at least one additional exchanger that ensures a pre-cooling of the gas stream before it is channeled to the corresponding exchanger, with the or each additional exchanger coming in the form of a double-flow exchanger that is supplied either by the gaseous vapor produced by the boiling of the liquid gas in the tank or by the cold gas that is evacuated or that escapes at the probe.
