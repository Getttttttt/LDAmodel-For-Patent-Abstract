id-WO2023134298A1    abstract-The invention discloses a secondary heat exchanger of a gas heating furnace, which comprises an outer shell, an inner water box, a plurality of heat exchange pipes, a water inlet interface, a water outlet interface and a flue gas rectifier plate. The outer shell is provided with a flue gas inlet and a flue gas outlet, and the flue gas inlet and the flue gas outlet are communicated with the inner cavity of the outer shell, and the outer end of a heat exchange pipe is communicated with the water inlet interface and the inner end is communicated with the inner water box. The outer end of the other part of the heat exchange tube is connected with the outlet interface, and the inner end is connected with the inner water box, and the flue gas rectifier plate with multiple through-holes is arranged to separate the inner chamber of the shell. The two parts of the heat exchange tube are located in the inner chamber of the shell, and are located in two different dividing chambers, forming a flow channel from the flue gas inlet to the flue gas outlet after passing through two dividing chambers in turn. By setting the flue gas rectifier plate, the flue gas flows through more heat exchange tubes in the secondary heat exchanger cavity, and the flow in the heat exchange area is more uniform, which can make the flue gas flow smoothly and improve the heat exchange efficiency.
id-EP4219986A1    abstract-3-way fluid valve (30), having a housing (31) providing a first connection port (32), a second connection port (33) and a third connection port (34), a valve plunger (35) 5 positioned within the housing (31), an actuator (36) for actuating the valve plunger (35) and for transferring the valve plunger (35) and thereby the 3-way fluid valve(30) between different states, wherein in a first state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-way fluid valve (30) a fluid flow through the first connection port (32) and throughthe second connection port (33) and through the third connection port (34) are all 10 blocked, wherein in a second state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-wayfluid valve (30) only a fluid flow through the first connection port (32) is blocked allowing a fluid flow from the second connection port (33) to the third connection port (34), wherein in a third state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-way fluid valve (30) only a fluid flow through third connection port (34) is blocked allowing a fluid flow from the first con-15 nection port (32) to the second connection port (33).
