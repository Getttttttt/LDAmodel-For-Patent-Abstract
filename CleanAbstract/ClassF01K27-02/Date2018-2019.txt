id-US10794369B1    abstract-A solar powered closed loop system and method for powering a cooling unit. The system and method provide a fully closed system that harnesses the power of the sun with a solar energy collecting device to generate vapor. The vapor has characteristics of high energy, expansion, and compressibility that enable travel through a plurality of conduits in the closed loop.

The relatively warm heat transfer medium returns to the supercritical fluid power generation system where a compressor and a thermal input device, such as a combustor, are used to increase the pressure and temperature of the heat transfer medium above its critical point to provide a supercritical heat transfer medium. A second portion of the extracted natural gas may be used as fuel for the thermal input device.
