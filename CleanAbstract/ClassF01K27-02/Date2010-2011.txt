id-US20110278859A1    abstract-In one general embodiment, a system includes a working fluid operable to be circulated through a working cycle. The working cycle includes one or more expander-generators driven by the working fluid to generate electrical power at a first condition; an evaporator heat exchanger; and a condenser heat exchanger. The system includes power electronics thermally coupled to a heat exchanger and adapted to convert the electrical power at the first condition to electrical power at a second condition; and a conduit in fluid communication with the working cycle and the heat exchanger. The conduit is adapted to circulate the working fluid through the heat exchanger such that heat generated by the power electronics is transferred to the working fluid.
id-US20120001436A1    abstract-An electric power generating system is provided that uses a wind turbine to generate waste-heat that is utilized in an organic Rankine Cycle drive that converts heat energy into rotation of a generator rotor for generating electricity. A hydrodynamic retarder may be provided that dissipates heat into a hot fluid by directing the flow of the fluid through the hydrodynamic retarder in a manner that resists rotation of blades of the wind turbine. The hot fluid circulating in the hydrodynamic retarder is a thermal heat source for vapor regeneration of organic heat exchange fluid mixture(s) used in the Rankine cycle, expansion of the organic heat exchange fluid being converted into rotation of the generator rotor.
id-EP2412942A2    abstract-The present invention provides an organic Rankine cycle energy recovery system comprising features which provide for fire suppression and/or ignition supression in the event of an unintentional release of a flammable component of the system, for example a flammable working fluid such as cyclopentane, into a part of the of the system in which the prevailing temperature is higher than the autoignition temperature of the flammable component. In one embodiment the organic Rankine cycle energy recovery system comprises an inert gas source disposed upstream of a hydrocarbon evaporator and is configured to purge the hydrocarbon evaporator with an inert gas on detection of a leak thereby.
