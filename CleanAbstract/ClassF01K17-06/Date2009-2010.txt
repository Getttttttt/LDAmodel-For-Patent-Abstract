id-US20100187822A1    abstract-The present invention relates to an energy efficient method of combined heat and power/combined-cycle electricity generation method and gasification method utilizing a multi-process method of producing, methane, biodiesel, and ethanol production. The waste heat from the combined heat and power generation/combined-cycle method and gasification method is utilized by these multiple methods in such a manner that the waste heat of each successive method serves directly as the heat reservoir for the succeeding method before it is reclaimed at the back-end of the combined-cycle method.
id-US8850817B2    abstract-The invention relates to a method for operating a steam turbine power plant comprising at least one steam generator that is fueled by lignite, wherein the lignite is indirectly dried in a fluidized bed dryer that is heated at least partially with steam from the water-steam circuit of the steam generator. Said method is characterized in that the flue gas from the steam generator undergoes gas scrubbing to remove CO2 and that the energy required for the gas scrubbing is at least partially extracted from the drying process in the fluidized bed. The invention additionally relates to a device for creating steam from lignite comprising a drying system for the lignite and a device to scrub CO2 from the flue gas, wherein the drying process and the CO2 gas scrubbing are thermally coupled to each other.
id-WO2010136797A3    abstract-A system for heating a primary air stream in a steam generating process comprising at least one primary air heat exchanger to exchange heat between the primary air stream in the primary air heat exchanger(s) and a process fluid.
id-US8887505B2    abstract-Provided are high-pressure, medium-pressure, and low-pressure turbines; a boiler to generate steam for driving the turbines; a carbon dioxide recovery unit including an absorber that reduces carbon dioxide in combustion flue gas from the boiler by a carbon dioxide absorbent and a regenerator that regenerates an absorbent; a first auxiliary turbine that extracts steam from an inlet of the low-pressure turbine and recovers power by the steam thus extracted; a first steam delivery line to supply discharged steam from the first auxiliary turbine to a reboiler of the regenerator as a heat source; and a controller that controls driving of the first auxiliary turbine while keeping pressure of the discharged steam to be supplied to the reboiler within a tolerance range for the reboiler's optimum pressure corresponding to a fluctuation in an operation load of the boiler.
