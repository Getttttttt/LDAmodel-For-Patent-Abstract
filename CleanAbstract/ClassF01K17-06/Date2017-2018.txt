id-US20190345847A1    abstract-The heat cycle facility includes: a first vaporizer that vaporizes a first liquid heating medium by combusting fuel; a first motive power generator that generates motive power by using as a drive fluid a first gas heating medium obtained at the first vaporizer; a condenser that condenses the first gas heating medium discharged from the first motive power generator by heat-exchanging the first gas heating medium for a second liquid heating medium; a circulator that pressurizes the first liquid heating medium obtained at the condenser and supplies the pressurized first liquid heating medium to the first vaporizer; a second vaporizer that produces gaseous ammonia by heat-exchanging the second liquid heating medium for liquid ammonia; and a supplier that supplies the liquid ammonia to the second vaporizer.
id-EP3358145A1    abstract-A method (100) includes determining, via a processor (39), a commanded temperature rate for a component of a steam turbine system (41). The method (100) further includes determining, via the processor (39), a measured temperature rate for the component of the steam turbine system (41). The method (100) additionally includes determining, via the processor (39), a variable multiplier based at least in part on the commanded temperature rate and the measured temperature rate. The method (100) also includes deriving, via the processor (39), a multiplied temperature rate command by applying the variable multiplier to the commanded temperature rate.
id-US20190002781A1    abstract-Biomass is processed into a slurry (Heavy Biofuel Oil or HBFO) comprising a fuel slurry suitable for low and medium speed diesel engines or other suitable power equipment that is produced by subjecting biomass feedstock to steam explosion processing, washing and separating unwanted materials, micronization to a targeted size, de-ashing with high pressure steam combined with micronization, and separation by means of classification of unwanted materials and a slurrification processes to make the HBFO suitable for use in internal combustion engines, such as diesel engine systems.
id-US20200224874A1    abstract-A fluidized bed boiler plant and a method of preheating combustion gas in a fluidized bed boiler plant. The boiler plant includes a furnace and a combustion gas channel, and a water-steam cycle including an evaporator section, a superheater section including a last superheater and a steam turbine, and a superheating path for conveying steam from the evaporator section via the superheater section to the steam turbine, and a first combustion gas preheater. The fluidized bed boiler plant includes a second combustion gas preheater, a steam extraction line attached in flow connection with the second combustion gas preheater and with the superheating path in a location upstream of the last superheater for conveying steam from the superheating path to the second combustion gas preheater.
id-US11018289B2    abstract-Disclosed is a thermoelectric generation system that generates electricity using waste heat from a steam condenser that exchanges heat with steam as cyclic water flows through a high temperature portion and a low temperature portion, the thermoelectric generation system including: a first hot-water discharge line used to discharge the cyclic water passing through the high temperature portion; a cyclic water circulation line through which the cyclic water from under water circulates; and a thermoelectric generation unit that generates electricity on the basis of a temperature difference between a temperature of the cyclic water flowing through the first hot-water discharge line and a temperature of the cyclic water flowing through the cyclic water circulation line.
