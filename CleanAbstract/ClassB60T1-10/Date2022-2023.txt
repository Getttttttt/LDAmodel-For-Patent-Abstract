id-US20230234590A1    abstract-A vehicle includes a regenerative braking device provided on regenerative braking wheels, which are any ones of front wheels and rear wheels, a frictional braking device configured to separately control a frictional braking force applied to each of the front wheels and the rear wheels, and an electronic control unit is configured to, upon detecting a slip state where a wheel speed of the regenerative braking wheels executing regenerative braking is below a slip determination threshold value positioned between a vehicle body speed and an anti-lock brake control operation threshold value, execute a regenerative control process for controlling the regenerative braking device such that the regenerative braking device generates a regenerative braking force that decreases a difference between the wheel speed and the slip determination threshold value.
id-US20230226920A1    abstract-Systems and methods for generating power for a tractor-trailer combination, including: a drop-lift axle coupled to the bottom of the trailer, the drop-lift axle to deploy at least one wheel when a primary brake is applied and the trailer is operating at a predetermined state; at least one regenerative brake retarder coupled to the at least one wheel, the at least one regenerative brake retarder to generate energy when the at least one wheel is deployed, wherein the at least one regenerative brake retarder acts as an auxiliary brake; and an energy storage system configured to store the energy generated by the at least one regenerative brake retarder, the energy storage system to release the stored energy a main battery to power at least one component of the trailer when needed.
id-US11702193B1    abstract-Braking systems and methods for an electrical vertical takeoff and landing aircraft are provided. A braking system may contain a pilot control device, brakes, wheels, sensors, and a controller. Pilot controls the pilot control device to transmit information to the controller such that the aircraft will slow down.
